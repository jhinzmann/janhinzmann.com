This is the somewhat, but not really first post of this blog.  
Maybe you ask yourself: **Why would someone not start a blog with the infamous *Hello, World!* post?**

In the process of creating this blog I actually [wrote some content]({{< ref "about-this-blog.md#history" >}}) before even having a running website locally.
Therefore this is more like a release post that marks the day this blog went online.
