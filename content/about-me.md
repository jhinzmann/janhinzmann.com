Hey, I’m **Jan Hinzmann**, 25 years old, from Germany and author of this Blog.  
I work at [Plan.One ccs GmbH](https://plan.one) as a **software developer**,  
where I do frontend programming mostly with **Angular**.

I earned my bachelor's degree in **Information Sciences for Business** and currently I am attending a master's degree program in **Practical Computer Science** at [FernUniversität Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/).

In my freetime I play the **Tuba** in an [orchestra](http://musikzug-spexard.de) and an [ensemble](http://www.suitebrass.de).

For more information or to contact me, see my profiles on [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Jan_Hinzmann4), [GitHub](https://github.com/jhinzmann) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jan_Hinzmann‚).
