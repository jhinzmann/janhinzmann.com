Hey, I’m **Jan Hinzmann**, 24 years old, from Germany and author of this Blog.  
I work at [itao GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.itao.de) as a **web developer**,  
where I do backend and frontend programming with languages like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL** and frameworks/libraries like **Neos, Flow, Angular, D3.js**.

I earned my bachelor's degree in **Information Sciences for Business** and currently I am attending a master's degree program in **Practical Computer Science** at [FernUniversität Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/).

In my freetime I play the **Tuba** in an [orchestra](http://musikzug-spexard.de) and an [ensemble](http://www.suitebrass.de).
